# 💫 About Me:
Hey, I’m Abhishek Varshney 👨‍💻

I’m a Senior Backend Developer based in Delhi, India, building scalable platforms and automation-heavy systems—mostly with Java + Spring Boot on AWS.

I enjoy designing clean backend architectures (microservices, serverless, event-driven flows) and shipping features that move real metrics—like improving engagement, reducing latency, and cutting manual ops work.

What I’ve worked on recently

* Built a real-time personalized Study Planner for 1,000+ daily users.
* Engineered a real-time execution tracker using AWS SQS (event-driven + async updates), reducing implementation time by 40% with Claude Code.
* Developed an automated subscription recommendation engine, reducing manual queries by 96% and improving conversions by 38%.
* Implemented a fully serverless media interaction tracker (Lambda + S3 + CloudFront), capturing 10,000+ daily video interactions.
* Migrated a legacy quiz platform from a stateful monolith to a stateless microservice architecture, reducing latency by 40%.
* Consolidated forums into a unified microservice and automated a large share of query responses using Claude AI + workflow tools.
* Diagnosed and fixed a production out-of-memory issue using New Relic + logs, leading to a 33% reduction in infrastructure costs.

Tech I use
Java, Spring Boot/Spring MVC, REST APIs, Microservices, Serverless (AWS Lambda), Event-driven systems (SQS/SNS), MySQL, PostgreSQL, Docker, Git, Postman, New Relic, AWS (API Gateway, RDS, CloudFront, EC2, Bedrock).
